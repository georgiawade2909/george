To make the image fit well on an iPhone screen, you can set the `width` to `100%`, ensuring that it takes up the full width of the container. Additionally, you can set `max-width` to a specific value to prevent the image from becoming too large on larger screens. Here's an updated version of the code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            background-color: #c8e6c9; /* light green background */
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            height: 100vh;
            color: #333; /* dark grey text color */
        }

        #fig-tree-container {
            text-align: center;
        }

        #fig-tree-image {
            width: 100%; /* Take up the full width of the container */
            max-width: 400px; /* Set a maximum width to prevent it from being too large on larger screens */
            height: auto;
        }

        #fig-tree-text {
            font-style: italic;
            margin-top: 20px;
        }
    </style>
    <title>Happy Valentine's Day, George</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="fig-tree-container">
        <img id="fig-tree-image" src="figure.png" alt="Fig Tree Image">
        <p id="fig-tree-text">
            <i>I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story...</i>
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

This will ensure that the image is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes, including iPhones. Adjust the `max-width` value as needed for your design preferences.
